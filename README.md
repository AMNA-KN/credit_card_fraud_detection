# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

## About

In today's digital world, credit card fraud is a significant concern. This project utilizes Python and various machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions and protect users from financial losses. The dataset used for training and testing contains labeled credit card transactions, allowing the models to learn patterns of fraudulent behavior

## Features

- Data preprocessing techniques to handle imbalanced data and normalize features

- Implementation of popular machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Adaboost,Knn, Decision tree

- Evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results

The models achieved an accuracy of 100%, with a precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and F1-score of 100% in KNN oversampling technique.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented algorithms in detecting credit card fraud

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques, such as anomaly detection algorithms

- Enhance the feature engineering process to capture additionalpatterns of fraudulent behavior

- Explore real-time fraud detection capabilities  ```^_^```
